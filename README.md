# SpaceInvaders
A space invader game I made in high school using p5js. If you don't know what p5js its just a java script library used for creative coding. I made a multi level space invader game with multiple different enemies and bosses with a health bar system. Future for this game is a main menu, better hit register, and a leaderboard.
